I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon AGI, working on the Nova Cross-modal Foundation Model. Before joining Amazon, I spent nearly seven years (2018–2025) at [Baidu VIS](https://vis.baidu.com/), where I grew from a research intern into a Senior/Staff Researcher and contributed to multiple large-scale computer vision and multimodal projects. Since 2021, I have been collaborating closely with Chief Scientist [Dr. Jingdong Wang (IEEE Fellow)](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/). I earned my Ph.D. from the MMLab at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), supervised by [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my M.S.E. degree from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Shifeng Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6X77S3cAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Yu Qiao](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao/).

Since 2016, I have been engaged in AI research and development across both academia and industry, gaining extensive experience at Amazon AGI, Baidu AIG, Snap Research, SenseTime Research, Samsung Research, and iQIYI AI. I have also been affiliated with leading academic institutions including MMLab@USYD, MMLab@CUHK, and MMLab@SIAT-CAS.

I am honored to have been awarded the Baidu PhD Fellowship (2023) and the DAAD AInet Fellowship (2025).
